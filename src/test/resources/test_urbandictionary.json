      "definition":"Epitomising the musical ideals of sub-underground black metal - the kind of stuff that comes out in limited editions of 300 through vinyl-only labels based in a cave in Belarus. The exact requirements of kvltness vary depending on who you talk to, but usually involve icy, impenetrable production, black-and-white cover art, and concepts drawn from black magic, pagan myths or out-and-out nihilism.\r\n\r\nLike anyone who takes art seriously these days, kvltists are the target of much mockery even from fellow extreme metal fans.",

      "definition":"Deriving from the word \"cult\", kvlt is spelled like it is in order to create a medieval vibe. \r\nThis is because it is used to speak positively of a metal band (particularly of the death/black metal variety) for their cult underground status. Is also applied the same way as [tr00]",

      "definition":"Pronounced as '[cult]'. kvlt is a way in the blackmetal scene - amongst other scences in which the philosophy houses that if less people know the work of art you want/pretend to like because less people know it your penis is bigger, to say that a work of art is terrible obscure and to live under the believe that that automatically makes a work of art better.\r\n\r\nThis philosphy is a stunning piece of reasoning and has kept me under the believe since I was 14 that the x-zillion types of unknown genres and obscure music I listen to is in fact better because it doesn't even sound like music anymore and  it still works perfect.\r\n\r\nSo get your kvltness today.",
